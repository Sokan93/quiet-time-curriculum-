        <h2>WEEK 1: PLANNING</h2>
        <h3>Day 1: Definition of Planning</h3>
        <p>Planning is the process of setting goals, identifying actions to achieve those goals, and allocating resources to accomplish them.</p>
        <div class="memory-verse">Proverbs 21:5 says, "The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty."</div>
        <h4>Examples of Planning:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Students planning their study schedule to achieve good grades.</li>
            <li>Athletes planning their training regimen to improve performance.</li>
            <li>Individuals planning their finances to achieve financial stability.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Types of Planning for Students:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Short-term planning:</strong> Planning for immediate tasks, such as completing homework or preparing for a test.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term planning:</strong> Planning for future goals, such as graduating from school or achieving a specific career.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily planning:</strong> Planning daily tasks and activities to stay organized and focused.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Effective planning helps students achieve their goals, manage time efficiently, and reduce stress. By planning, students can prioritize tasks, stay focused, and make progress towards their objectives.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Planning is an essential skill for students to develop. By setting goals, identifying actions, and allocating resources, students can achieve success and reach their full potential. Proverbs 16:9 says, "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps." May God guide and direct us as we plan our lives.</p>
        <div class="reflection-box"><strong>Reflection:</strong> Take a moment to reflect on your own planning habits. What goals do you want to achieve? What steps can you take to plan and achieve those goals?</div>

        <h3>Day 2: Elements of Planning</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Goals and Objectives:</strong> Clearly defining what you want to achieve through your plan. Proverbs 29:18 says, "Where there is no vision, the people perish." Example: A student sets a goal to achieve a certain grade in their exams.</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Gathering and analyzing information to understand the situation, resources, and potential obstacles. Luke 14:28-30 says, "For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?" Example: A business owner conducts market research to understand their target audience and competition.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Determining the best approach or course of action to achieve your goals. Proverbs 21:5 says, "The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty."</li>
            <li><strong>Action Plan:</strong> Outlining specific steps and tasks to be taken to implement your strategy. James 2:26 says, "For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead."</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Identifying and allocating the necessary resources (time, money, personnel, etc.) to execute your plan. Luke 14:31-32.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Establishing a schedule or timeline for completing tasks and achieving milestones. Ecclesiastes 3:1 says, "For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven."</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluation and Monitoring:</strong> Planning for how you will track progress, evaluate success, and make adjustments as needed. Proverbs 15:28 says, "The heart of the righteous weighs its answers, but the mouth of the wicked pours out evil."</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Day 3: Consequences of Lack of Planning for Students</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Poor Time Management:</strong> Without planning, students may struggle to manage their time effectively, leading to missed deadlines and poor grades. Proverbs 21:5.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Stress:</strong> Lack of planning can lead to increased stress and anxiety, negatively impacting mental and physical health. Matthew 6:34 says, "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."</li>
            <li><strong>Missed Opportunities:</strong> Without planning, students may miss opportunities for growth, learning, and development. Luke 12:48.</li>
            <li><strong>Poor Goal Achievement:</strong> Lack of planning can hinder students' ability to achieve their goals, leading to disappointment and frustration.</li>
            <li><strong>Inefficiency and Waste:</strong> Without planning, students may waste time and resources on non-essential activities. Proverbs 24:27.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Day 4: Effects and Benefits of Planning</h3>
        <h4>Benefits of Planning:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increased Productivity:</strong> Planning helps individuals prioritize tasks, manage time effectively, and increase productivity. Proverbs 21:5.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced Stress:</strong> Planning helps individuals feel more in control, reducing stress and anxiety. Matthew 6:34.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Goal Achievement:</strong> Planning helps individuals set and achieve goals, leading to a sense of accomplishment. Proverbs 16:9.</li>
            <li><strong>Better Time Management:</strong> Planning helps individuals prioritize tasks and make the most of their time. Ephesians 5:16.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Effects of Planning:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increased Confidence:</strong> Planning can increase confidence and self-esteem, leading to greater success. Proverbs 24:27.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Decision Making:</strong> Planning can improve decision making by considering options and outcomes. James 1:5.</li>
            <li><strong>Greater Sense of Control:</strong> Planning can give individuals a greater sense of control over their lives. Jeremiah 29:11.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 5: Guided Practice</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1: Set Goals.</strong> Identify what you want to achieve. Make sure your goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Example: Improve grades in math by scoring 85% or higher on the next test.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2: Identify Tasks.</strong> Break down your goal into smaller tasks. Identify what needs to be done. Example: Reviewing notes daily, practicing problems regularly, seeking help from a tutor.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3: Create a Schedule.</strong> Plan out when and how you will complete each task. Use a planner, calendar, or app to stay organized.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4: Track Progress.</strong> Regularly review your progress towards your goal. Make adjustments to your plan as needed.</p>

        <h2>WEEK 2: SEXUAL VICES</h2>
        <div class="memory-verse">MEMORY VERSE: “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?” – 1 Corinthians 6:19</div>
        
        <h3>Day 1: Introduction and Definition</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br>
        Sexual vices among students have become a growing concern in many societies today. With increased exposure to social media, peer influence, and changing moral values, many students are vulnerable to unhealthy behaviours that can negatively affect their education, character, and future. This study seeks to examine these behaviours and their impact on students.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Definition of Sexual Vices</strong><br>
        Sexual vices refer to unacceptable or harmful sexual-related behaviours that go against moral standards, school rules, and societal values. Among students, these behaviours are considered inappropriate because they interfere with healthy development, discipline, and academic focus.</p>
        <h4>SOME SEXUAL VICES:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Homosexuality:</strong> Sexual acts between people of the same gender. (Leviticus 18:22)</li>
            <li><strong>Incest:</strong> Sexual activities between family members. (Leviticus 18:7-18)</li>
            <li><strong>Paedophilia:</strong> Sexual attraction towards children.</li>
            <li><strong>Bestiality:</strong> Sexual affair with an animal. (Leviticus 18:23)</li>
            <li><strong>Rape:</strong> Forceful sexual intercourse with an unwilling partner. (2 Samuel 13:10-14)</li>
            <li><strong>Pornography:</strong> Explicit depiction of sexual subject matter with lustful intent. It is addictive and destructive.</li>
            <li><strong>Masturbation and use of sex toys</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Cyber-sex/Phone-sex:</strong> Sex-oriented conversations over the internet or phone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 2: Forms of Sexual Vices Among Students</h3>
        <p><strong>2.1 Premature Sexual Activities:</strong> This refers to students engaging in sexual behaviours at an early age before they are emotionally, mentally, or physically mature. Such actions can lead to distraction from studies, emotional stress, and poor decision-making.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2 Exposure to Inappropriate Media:</strong> Many students are exposed to inappropriate content through phones, the internet, movies, or social media. This exposure can influence their thinking, behaviour, and attitude toward relationships, leading to imitation of harmful actions.</p>
        <p><strong>2.3 Sexual Harassment and Abuse:</strong> Sexual harassment involves unwanted sexual comments, gestures, or actions, while abuse includes forcing or manipulating someone into sexual acts. These behaviours violate personal rights and can cause long-term emotional and psychological harm to victims.</p>
        <p><strong>2.4 Peer-Influenced Risky Behaviours:</strong> Some students engage in sexual vices due to pressure from friends who encourage them to act in certain ways to “fit in” or appear mature. Peer pressure often leads students to make choices they would not make independently.</p>

        <h3>Day 3: Causes of Sexual Vices Among Students</h3>
        <p><strong>3.1 Peer Pressure:</strong> Students often feel the need to belong. When peers promote immoral behaviours, some students follow along to gain acceptance, even when they know such actions are wrong.</p>
        <p><strong>3.2 Lack of Proper Guidance and Supervision:</strong> When parents, teachers, or guardians fail to provide adequate guidance, students may lack moral direction. Poor supervision gives room for negative behaviours to grow unnoticed.</p>
        <p><strong>3.3 Influence of Social Media and Technology:</strong> Easy access to smartphones and the internet exposes students to inappropriate ideas and behaviours. Without proper monitoring, technology can negatively shape students’ values and actions.</p>
        <p><strong>3.4 Poor Moral and Value Education:</strong> A weak foundation in moral, religious, or value-based education can make students vulnerable to sexual vices. When students are not taught self-control and respect, they may engage in irresponsible behaviours.</p>

        <h3>Day 4: Effects of Sexual Vices on Students</h3>
        <p><strong>4.1 Academic Performance:</strong> Sexual vices often distract students from their studies. Loss of concentration, absenteeism, and lack of interest in schoolwork can result in poor academic achievement.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2 Emotional and Psychological Well-being:</strong> Students involved in sexual vices may experience guilt, fear, anxiety, or emotional confusion. Victims of abuse may suffer low self-esteem and trauma.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3 Health and Safety Concerns:</strong> Engaging in unsafe behaviours can expose students to serious health risks and emotional harm, which can affect their overall development.</p>
        <p><strong>4.4 Social and Moral Development:</strong> Sexual vices can damage a student’s reputation and moral standing. It may lead to loss of respect from peers, teachers, and the community.</p>

        <h3>Day 5: Prevention and Control of Sexual Vices</h3>
        <p><strong>5.1 Role of Parents and Guardians:</strong> Parents should communicate openly with their children, provide moral guidance, monitor media use, and be positive role models. Strong family values help students make better choices.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2 Role of Schools and Teachers:</strong> Schools should teach moral and civic education, enforce clear rules and discipline, provide counselling services, and create a safe learning environment.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3 Student Self-Discipline and Responsibility:</strong> Students must learn to make wise decisions, respect themselves and others, avoid negative peer influence, and focus on personal growth and academics.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Role of Society and Government:</strong> Organizing community awareness programs and enforcing policies that protect students from abuse.</p>

        <h2>WEEK 3: INFATUATION</h2>
        <div class="memory-verse">Text: 1 CORINTHIANS 13:4-7<br>“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud... It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.”</div>
        
        <h3>Day 1: Introduction to Infatuation</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br>
        Infatuation is a strong but usually short-lived emotional attraction to someone. It often begins suddenly and feels very intense at the start. Most times, it is based on physical appearance or imagined qualities, not on truly knowing the person’s character. Because it is not deep, it can fade quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Characteristics of Infatuation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Develops suddenly:</strong> The feelings appear very fast, sometimes after just a short interaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong emotional excitement:</strong> The person feels overly happy, nervous, or thrilled.</li>
            <li><strong>Excessive admiration:</strong> The person is seen as “perfect,” even without good reason.</li>
            <li><strong>Unrealistic expectations:</strong> The individual expects too much without understanding reality.</li>
            <li><strong>Short duration:</strong> The feelings may not last long.</li>
            <li><strong>Focuses more on feelings than facts:</strong> Decisions are based on emotions, not careful thinking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 2: Causes of Infatuation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Physical Attraction:</strong> Happens when someone is drawn to another person’s looks, voice, dressing style, or mannerisms. This Focusing mainly on appearance can create strong feelings without deep understanding.</li>
            <li><strong>Loneliness or Emotional Need:</strong> When a person feels emotionally empty, they may strongly desire attention, love, or care. This emotional gap can cause them to quickly attach feelings to anyone who shows interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Peer Pressure:</strong> Sometimes friends encourage relationships so that one can “fit in” or not feel left out. Seeing others in relationships may create pressure to have one too.</li>
            <li><strong>Media Influence:</strong> Movies, music, and social media often portray love as perfect, exciting, and effortless. These unrealistic images can shape expectations and make people believe infatuation is true love.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Emotional Maturity:</strong> Emotional maturity helps a person understand and control their feelings. When someone lacks this maturity, they may confuse excitement, attraction, or attention with love.</li>
            <li><strong>Curiosity or Excitement:</strong> The desire to experience something new or thrilling can also cause infatuation. The mystery of a new connection creates intense feelings that fade once the excitement wears off.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Day 3: Signs of Infatuation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Constantly Thinking About the Person:</strong> A major sign of infatuation is when someone thinks about a particular person almost all the time. The person may replay conversations, imagine future moments, or feel distracted.</li>
            <li><strong>Ignoring the Person’s Faults:</strong> When someone is infatuated, they tend to focus only on positive qualities. Any weaknesses, bad habits, or mistakes are either ignored or justified.</li>
            <li><strong>Mood Depends on Attention:</strong> emotions rise and fall based on how the other person behaves. A kind message brings happiness; silence or lack of attention causes sadness or worry.</li>
            <li><strong>Desire for Quick Closeness:</strong> Infatuation often creates a strong desire to become emotionally close very quickly, wanting deep commitment before truly knowing the other person well.</li>
            <li><strong>Difficulty Concentrating:</strong> Because thoughts are focused on the person, concentration on schoolwork, chores, or responsibilities may reduce.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Day 1: Meaning and Ethics</h3>
        <p>Examination is a formal test of a person’s knowledge or proficiency. It is an opportunity to know how well you understand. 1 Thessalonians 5:21 says "examine everything carefully". Maintain ethical standards. Academic dishonesty includes cheating, fabrication, assisting others in deception, tampering, and plagiarism.</p>
        
        <h3>Day 2: In the Exam Room</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Read instructions carefully. Check rubric for compulsory questions.</li>
            <li>Work out the timing. Divide time by questions. Allow for planning and checking.</li>
            <li>Read the questions carefully. Read through the paper once before choosing.</li>
            <li>Choose your best questions first to build confident momentum.</li>
            <li>Decide on question order wisely.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Day 3: How to Answer Multiple Choice Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Read the entire question before glancing at answer options.</li>
            <li>Answer it in your mind first to prevent being swayed by distractors.</li>
            <li>Use the process of elimination to cross out known incorrect answers.</li>
            <li>Select the BEST answer requested, not just one that seems correct.</li>
            <li>Watch for absolute words like "always", "never", "must".</li>
            <li>Manage your time and keep an eye on the clock.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Day 4: Attempt Each Question Correctly</h3>
        <p>Colossians 3:23 — “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart...”</p>

            <li><strong>Explain:</strong> Give definition, examples, and talk more on what you know.</li>

        <h2>WEEK 7: BULLYING</h2>
        <div class="memory-verse">Memory verse: "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you." – Ephesians 4:32</div>
        
        <h3>Day 1: Understanding Bullying</h3>
        <p>Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated over time.</p>
        <h4>The Four Types of Bullying:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Verbal:</strong> Name-calling, teasing, and threatening.</li>
            <li><strong>Social (Relational):</strong> Spreading rumors, purposeful exclusion, or public embarrassment.</li>
            <li><strong>Physical:</strong> Hitting, kicking, tripping, or damaging property.</li>
            <li><strong>Cyberbullying:</strong> Harassment via the internet, social media, or texts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bullying is an intentional choice to hurt someone. It is never the victim's fault.</p>

        <h3>Day 2: The Effects of Bullying</h3>
        <p>Bullying leaves "invisible wounds" that can hurt for years. It affects the target, the bully, and the bystander.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For the Target:</strong> leads to low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and physical symptoms like headaches.</li>
            <li><strong>For the Bully:</strong> higher risk for substance abuse and legal trouble as adults.</li>
            <li><strong>For the Bystander:</strong> often feel guilty or afraid that they might be the next target.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 3: Why Do People Bully?</h3>
        <p>Understanding the bully doesn't excuse them, but helps us see that hurt people often hurt others.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mask of Power:</strong> Acting out due to feeling powerless at home or having low confidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Peer Pressure:</strong> Bullying to maintain a high social status or "fit in."</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Empathy:</strong> Failing to recognize or care about the feelings of others.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 4: How to Handle Being Bullied</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Don't React:</strong> Bullies want to see you upset. Keep a calm, neutral face.</li>
            <li><strong>The Power of "Stop":</strong> firm, clear voice, then walk away.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Retaliate:</strong> Fighting back often escalates violence.</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting vs. Snitching:</strong> reporting is done to keep people safe; snitching is done to get people in trouble.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 5: Being an "Upstander"</h3>
        <p>A bystander watches; an <strong>upstander</strong> takes action to help. Speak up if safe, distract the bully, and support the victim later. A community is only as safe as its members make it. Sign a "Peace Pledge" to look out for one another.</p>
        <div class="reflection-box"><strong>The Upstander Pledge:</strong> I will choose to stand up for others, report incidents to adults, and treat every classmate with dignity.</div>
