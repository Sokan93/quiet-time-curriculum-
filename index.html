        <h2>WEEK 1: Planning</h2>
        
        <h3>Day 1: Definition of Planning</h3>
        <h4>Topic: Planning</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition of Planning:</strong><br>
        Planning is the process of setting goals, identifying actions to achieve those goals, and allocating resources to accomplish them. Proverbs 21:5 says, <em>"The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty."</em></p>
        
        <h4>Examples:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Students planning their study schedule to achieve good grades.</li>
            <li>Athletes planning their training regimen to improve performance.</li>
            <li>Individuals planning their finances to achieve financial stability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Types of Planning for Students:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Short-term planning:</strong> Planning for immediate tasks, such as completing homework or preparing for a test.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term planning:</strong> Planning for future goals, such as graduating from school or achieving a specific career.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily planning:</strong> Planning daily tasks and activities to stay organized and focused.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Evaluation:</h4>
        <p>Effective planning helps students achieve their goals, manage time efficiently, and reduce stress. By planning, students can prioritize tasks, stay focused, and make progress towards their objectives.</p>

        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
        <p>Planning is an essential skill for students to develop. By setting goals, identifying actions, and allocating resources, students can achieve success and reach their full potential. Proverbs 16:9 says, <em>"In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps."</em> May God guide and direct us as we plan our lives.</p>

        <h4>Reflection:</h4>
        <p>Take a moment to reflect on your own planning habits. What goals do you want to achieve? What steps can you take to plan and achieve those goals?</p>

            <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Identifying and allocating necessary resources (time, money, etc.). <blockquote>Luke 14:31-32.</blockquote> <strong>Example:</strong> A non-profit organization allocates funds to different programs.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Establishing a schedule for completing tasks. <blockquote>Ecclesiastes 3:1 says, "For everything there is a season..."</blockquote> <strong>Example:</strong> A construction team creates a project timeline.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluation and Monitoring:</strong> Planning how to track progress and make adjustments. <blockquote>Proverbs 15:28.</blockquote> <strong>Example:</strong> A business owner reviews sales data to evaluate their marketing strategy.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Q&A:</h4>
        <p><strong>Q: Why is planning important?</strong><br>
        <strong>A:</strong> It helps achieve goals, reduces uncertainty, minimizes risks, and maximizes opportunities.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: What is the difference between a goal and an objective?</strong><br>
        <strong>A:</strong> A goal is a broad statement; an objective is a specific, measurable step to achieve that goal.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Why is evaluation and monitoring important?</strong><br>
        <strong>A:</strong> They help you track progress, evaluate success, and make adjustments as needed.</p>

        <h2>WEEK 7: Actions and Effects</h2>
        
        <h3>Day 1: Actions and Their Consequences</h3>
        <blockquote><strong>Memory verse:</strong> Galatians 6:7 "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."</blockquote>
        <p>All our actions have consequences. Your actions are seeds that determine your harvest. In 1 Kings 2, David instructed Solomon to deal with three people based on their past actions: <strong>Joab</strong> (who murdered and was executed), <strong>Barzillai</strong> (who was kind and his children were rewarded), and <strong>Shimei</strong> (who was disrespectful and was executed). Be careful what you do; there are always consequences.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Day 2: Avoid Unwholesome Actions</h3>
        <p>Unwholesome actions are negative deeds that stem from harmful intentions. Always remember that your actions have consequences, even those done in secret (Luke 12:2-3). The Bible is full of examples: Adam and Eve, Cain, Achan, Saul, and David all faced consequences for their actions. If you are living in sin, repent. The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23).</p>
        
        <hr>

        <h3>Day 3: The Consequences of Disrespect</h3>
        <p>Disrespect is a failure to honor God, authority, and others, and it has serious consequences.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Disrespect Towards God:</strong> In Numbers 16, Korah was swallowed by the earth for his rebellion.</li>
            <li><strong>Disrespect Towards Parents:</strong> The fifth commandment is "Honor your father and mother" (Exodus 20:12).</li>
            <li><strong>Disrespect Towards Authority:</strong> Romans 13 teaches that resisting authorities is opposing God.</li>
            <li><strong>Disrespect Among Peers:</strong> Proverbs warns that it leads to discord.</li>
            <li><strong>Disrespect in the Church:</strong> The Corinthians faced judgment for their behavior (1 Corinthians 11:30).</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>
        
        <h3>Day 4: The Power in Your Action</h3>
        <p>In Acts 3:1-7, Peter took action to heal a lame man. <strong>Action speaks louder than words.</strong> The only way to create change is to take the first step. This requires courage and persistence. Nehemiah didn't just wish for the walls of Jerusalem to be rebuilt; he led the effort. Your actions determine your achievement. Match your desires with action.</p>

        <h3>Day 5: Biblical View on Handling Challenges</h3>
        <p>God’s Word provides guidance for handling challenges.</p>

        <h3>Day 1: Examination Culture</h3>
        <blockquote>1 Corinthians 14:40 - "Let all things be done decently and in order."</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Examination culture</strong> is the way you act, think, and behave in an examination hall. Be orderly, obey instructions, and do not engage in any form of malpractice.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3>Day 2: Don’t Relent, Remain Focused</h3>
        <blockquote>1 Corinthians 9:24: "...So run, that ye may obtain."</blockquote>
        <p>Do not give up on your preparation. Give each paper your best. Have the mindset of Paul who said, “I press on to reach the end of the race...” (Philippians 3:14).</p>

        <h2>WEEK 11: The Light of the World</h2>
        
        <h3>Day 1: The Source of Light</h3>
        <p>The true source of light is Jesus Christ, who said, “I am the light of the world” (John 8:12). Any light we have comes from Him. Christians are a reflection of His light, and our purpose is to shine for Him so that He receives the glory.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3>Day 2: Types of Light</h3>

            <li><strong>Physical Light:</strong> The light we see with our eyes.</li>
            <li><strong>Spiritual Light:</strong> The more important light of Truth from Jesus. A believer is always drawn to this light, while an unbeliever avoids it because it exposes their deeds.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <hr>

        <h3>Day 3: The Usefulness of the Light of the World</h3>
        <blockquote>Matthew 5:14-16 - “You are the light of the world... let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.”</blockquote>
        <p>Jesus has appointed us to be the light of the world. Light <strong>guides</strong> by illuminating truth, sets the <strong>moral lead</strong> by example, and <strong>stands out</strong> in the darkness.</p>
        
        <hr>

        <h3>Day 4: The Power Of Light</h3>
        <p>Light was the first thing God created (Genesis 1:3). Light <strong>shines</strong>, <strong>heals</strong>, <strong>dispels darkness</strong>, <strong>rules</strong>, and <strong>quickens</strong> (brings life). As children of light, we are to have no fellowship with darkness.</p>
        
        <hr>

        <h3>Day 5: Significance of the Light</h3>
        <p>Jesus called us to be light-bearers. Our light must shine so that others might see Jesus in us and believe. The light illuminates our path forward. Our future is in Heaven, a place with no darkness, where God will be our light forever.</p>
