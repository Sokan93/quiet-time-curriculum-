        <h2>WEEK 1: PLANNING</h2>
        <h3>Day 1: Definition of Planning</h3>
        <p>Planning is the process of setting goals, identifying actions to achieve those goals, and allocating resources to accomplish them.</p>
        <div class="memory-verse">Proverbs 21:5 says, "The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty."</div>
        <h4>Examples:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Students planning their study schedule to achieve good grades.</li>
            <li>Athletes planning their training regimen to improve performance.</li>
            <li>Individuals planning their finances to achieve financial stability.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Types of Planning for Students:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Short-term planning:</strong> Planning for immediate tasks, such as completing homework or preparing for a test.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term planning:</strong> Planning for future goals, such as graduating from school or achieving a specific career.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily planning:</strong> Planning daily tasks and activities to stay organized and focused.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Effective planning helps students achieve their goals, manage time efficiently, and reduce stress. By planning, students can prioritize tasks, stay focused, and make progress towards their objectives.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Planning is an essential skill for students to develop. By setting goals, identifying actions, and allocating resources, students can achieve success and reach their full potential. Proverbs 16:9 says, "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps." May God guide and direct us as we plan our lives.</p>
        <div class="reflection-box"><strong>Reflection:</strong> Take a moment to reflect on your own planning habits. What goals do you want to achieve? What steps can you take to plan and achieve those goals?</div>

        <h3>Day 2: Elements of Planning</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Goals and Objectives:</strong> Clearly defining what you want to achieve through your plan. Proverbs 29:18 says, "Where there is no vision, the people perish." Example: A student sets a goal to achieve a certain grade in their exams.</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Gathering and analyzing information to understand the situation, resources, and potential obstacles. Luke 14:28-30 says, "For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?"</li>
            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Determining the best approach or course of action to achieve your goals. Proverbs 21:5.</li>
            <li><strong>Action Plan:</strong> Outlining specific steps and tasks to be taken to implement your strategy. James 2:26 says, "For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead."</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Identifying and allocating the necessary resources (time, money, personnel, etc.) to execute your plan. Luke 14:31-32.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Establishing a schedule or timeline for completing tasks and achieving milestones. Ecclesiastes 3:1.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluation and Monitoring:</strong> Planning for how you will track progress, evaluate success, and make adjustments as needed. Proverbs 15:28.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Day 3: Consequences of Lack of Planning for Students</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Poor Time Management:</strong> Without planning, students may struggle to manage their time effectively, leading to missed deadlines and poor grades. Proverbs 21:5.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Stress:</strong> Lack of planning can lead to increased stress and anxiety, negatively impacting mental and physical health. Matthew 6:34.</li>
            <li><strong>Missed Opportunities:</strong> Without planning, students may miss opportunities for growth, learning, and development. Luke 12:48.</li>
            <li><strong>Poor Goal Achievement:</strong> Lack of planning can hinder students' ability to achieve their goals, leading to disappointment and frustration. Proverbs 16:9.</li>
            <li><strong>Inefficiency and Waste:</strong> Without planning, students may waste time and resources on non-essential activities. Proverbs 24:27.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Day 4: Effects and Benefits of Planning</h3>
        <h4>Benefits:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased Productivity (Proverbs 21:5).</li>
            <li>Reduced Stress (Matthew 6:34).</li>
            <li>Improved Goal Achievement (Proverbs 16:9).</li>
            <li>Better Time Management (Ephesians 5:16).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Effects:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased Confidence (Proverbs 24:27).</li>
            <li>Improved Decision Making (James 1:5).</li>
            <li>Greater Sense of Control (Jeremiah 29:11).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 5: Guided Practice</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1: Set Goals (SMART).</strong> Identify what you want to achieve. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2: Identify Tasks.</strong> Break down your goal into smaller tasks (e.g., Reviewing notes daily, practicing problems, seeking a tutor).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3: Create a Schedule.</strong> Plan when and how you will complete each task using a planner or app.</p>

        <h2>WEEK 2: SEXUAL VICES</h2>
        <div class="memory-verse">MEMORY VERSE: “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?” – 1 Corinthians 6:19</div>
        
        <h3>Day 1: Introduction and Definition</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br>
        Sexual vices among students have become a growing concern in many societies today. With increased exposure to social media, peer influence, and changing moral values, many students are vulnerable to unhealthy behaviours that can negatively affect their education, character, and future. This study seeks to examine these behaviours and their impact on students.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Definition of Sexual Vices</strong><br>
        Sexual vices refer to unacceptable or harmful sexual-related behaviours that go against moral standards, school rules, and societal values. Among students, these behaviours are considered inappropriate because they interfere with healthy development, discipline, and academic focus.</p>
        <h4>SOME SEXUAL VICES:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Homosexuality:</strong> Sexual acts between people of the same gender. (Leviticus 18:22)</li>
            <li><strong>Incest:</strong> Sexual activities between family members. (Leviticus 18:7-18)</li>
            <li><strong>Paedophilia:</strong> Sexual attraction towards children.</li>
            <li><strong>Bestiality:</strong> Sexual affair with an animal. (Leviticus 18:23)</li>
            <li><strong>Rape:</strong> Forceful sexual intercourse with an unwilling partner. (2 Samuel 13:10-14)</li>
            <li><strong>Pornography:</strong> Explicit depiction of sexual subject matter with lustful intent. It is addictive and destructive.</li>
            <li><strong>Masturbation and use of sex toys</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Cyber-sex/Phone-sex:</strong> Sex-oriented conversations over the internet or phone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 2: Forms of Sexual Vices Among Students</h3>
        <p><strong>2.1 Premature Sexual Activities:</strong> This refers to students engaging in sexual behaviours at an early age before they are emotionally, mentally, or physically mature. Such actions can lead to distraction from studies, emotional stress, and poor decision-making.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2 Exposure to Inappropriate Media:</strong> Many students are exposed to inappropriate content through phones, the internet, movies, or social media. This exposure can influence their thinking, behaviour, and attitude toward relationships, leading to imitation of harmful actions.</p>
        <p><strong>2.3 Sexual Harassment and Abuse:</strong> Sexual harassment involves unwanted sexual comments, gestures, or actions, while abuse includes forcing or manipulating someone into sexual acts. These behaviours violate personal rights and can cause long-term emotional and psychological harm to victims.</p>
        <p><strong>2.4 Peer-Influenced Risky Behaviours:</strong> Some students engage in sexual vices due to pressure from friends who encourage them to act in certain ways to “fit in” or appear mature. Peer pressure often leads students to make choices they would not make independently.</p>

        <h3>Day 3: Causes of Sexual Vices Among Students</h3>
        <p><strong>3.1 Peer Pressure:</strong> Students often feel the need to belong. When peers promote immoral behaviours, some students follow along to gain acceptance, even when they know such actions are wrong.</p>
        <p><strong>3.2 Lack of Proper Guidance and Supervision:</strong> When parents, teachers, or guardians fail to provide adequate guidance, students may lack moral direction. Poor supervision gives room for negative behaviours to grow unnoticed.</p>
        <p><strong>3.3 Influence of Social Media and Technology:</strong> Easy access to smartphones and the internet exposes students to inappropriate ideas and behaviours. Without proper monitoring, technology can negatively shape students’ values and actions.</p>
        <p><strong>3.4 Poor Moral and Value Education:</strong> A weak foundation in moral, religious, or value-based education can make students vulnerable to sexual vices. When students are not taught self-control and respect, they may engage in irresponsible behaviours.</p>

        <h3>Day 4: Effects of Sexual Vices on Students</h3>
        <p><strong>4.1 Academic Performance:</strong> Sexual vices often distract students from their studies. Loss of concentration, absenteeism, and lack of interest in schoolwork can result in poor academic achievement.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2 Emotional and Psychological Well-being:</strong> Students involved in sexual vices may experience guilt, fear, anxiety, or emotional confusion. Victims of abuse may suffer low self-esteem and trauma.</p>

        <p><strong>4.4 Social and Moral Development:</strong> Sexual vices can damage a student’s reputation and moral standing. It may lead to loss of respect from peers, teachers, and the community.</p>

        <h3>Day 5: Prevention and Control of Sexual Vices</h3>
        <p><strong>5.1 Role of Parents and Guardians:</strong> Parents should: Communicate openly with their children, Provide moral guidance, Monitor media use, Be positive role models. Strong family values help students make better choices.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2 Role of Schools and Teachers:</strong> Schools should: Teach moral and civic education, Enforce clear rules and discipline, Provide counselling services, Create a safe learning environment. Teachers play a key role in guiding students.</p>

            <li><strong>3.4 Poor Moral and Value Education:</strong> A weak foundation in moral, religious, or value-based education can make students vulnerable to sexual vices. When students are not taught self-control and respect, they may engage in irresponsible behaviours.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 4: Effects of Sexual Vices on Students</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4.1 Academic Performance:</strong> Sexual vices often distract students from their studies. Loss of concentration, absenteeism, and lack of interest in schoolwork can result in poor academic achievement.</li>
            <li><strong>4.2 Emotional and Psychological Well-being:</strong> Students involved in sexual vices may experience guilt, fear, anxiety, or emotional confusion. Victims of abuse may suffer low self-esteem and trauma.</li>
            <li><strong>4.3 Health and Safety Concerns:</strong> Engaging in unsafe behaviours can expose students to serious health risks and emotional harm, which can affect their overall development.</li>
            <li><strong>4.4 Social and Moral Development:</strong> Sexual vices can damage a student’s reputation and moral standing. It may lead to loss of respect from peers, teachers, and the community.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 5: Prevention and Control of Sexual Vices</h3>
        <p><strong>5.1 Role of Parents and Guardians:</strong> Parents should communicate openly with their children, provide moral guidance, and monitor media use. Strong family values help students make better choices.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2 Role of Schools and Teachers:</strong> Schools should teach moral and civic education, enforce clear rules and discipline, and provide counselling services.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3 Student Self-Discipline and Responsibility:</strong> Students must learn to make wise decisions, respect themselves and others, avoid negative peer influence, and focus on personal growth and academics.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Role of Society and Government:</strong> Organizing community awareness programs and enforcing school policies that protect students from abuse.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Sexual vices among students pose serious challenges to education, morality, and personal development. Addressing this issue requires collective effort from parents, schools, society, and the students themselves.</p>

        <h2>WEEK 3: INFATUATION</h2>
        <div class="memory-verse">Text: 1 CORINTHIANS 13:4-7<br>“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud... It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.”</div>
        
        <h3>Day 1: Introduction to Infatuation</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br>
        Infatuation is a strong but usually short-lived emotional attraction to someone. It often begins suddenly and feels very intense at the start. Most times, it is based on physical appearance or imagined qualities, not on truly knowing the person’s character. Because it is not deep, it can fade quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Characteristics of Infatuation</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Develops suddenly:</strong> The feelings appear very fast, sometimes after just a short interaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong emotional excitement:</strong> The person feels overly happy, nervous, or thrilled.</li>
            <li><strong>Excessive admiration:</strong> The person is seen as “perfect,” even without good reason.</li>
            <li><strong>Unrealistic expectations:</strong> The individual expects too much without understanding reality.</li>
            <li><strong>Short duration:</strong> The feelings may not last long.</li>
            <li><strong>Focuses more on feelings than facts:</strong> Decisions are based on emotions, not careful thinking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 2: Causes of Infatuation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Physical Attraction:</strong> Happens when someone is drawn to another person’s looks, voice, dressing style, or mannerisms. This Focusing mainly on appearance can create strong feelings without deep understanding.</li>
            <li><strong>Loneliness or Emotional Need:</strong> When a person feels emotionally empty, they may strongly desire attention, love, or care. This emotional gap can cause them to quickly attach feelings to anyone who shows interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Peer Pressure:</strong> Sometimes friends encourage relationships so that one can “fit in.” Seeing others in relationships may create pressure to have one too.</li>
            <li><strong>Media Influence:</strong> Movies, music, and social media often portray love as perfect, exciting, and effortless. These unrealistic images make people believe infatuation is true love.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Emotional Maturity:</strong> Emotional maturity helps a person understand and control their feelings. When someone lacks this maturity, they may confuse excitement or attention with love.</li>
            <li><strong>Curiosity or Excitement:</strong> The desire to experience something new or thrilling can also cause infatuation. The mystery of a new connection creates intense feelings that fade once the excitement wears off.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Day 3: Signs of Infatuation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Constantly Thinking About the Person:</strong> A major sign is when someone thinks about a particular person almost all the time. The person may replay conversations or feel distracted.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Ignoring the Person’s Faults:</strong> When someone is infatuated, they tend to focus only on positive qualities. Any weaknesses, bad habits, or mistakes are either ignored or justified.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Mood Depends on Attention:</strong> In infatuation, emotions rise and fall based on how the other person behaves. A kind message brings happiness; silence causes worry.</li>
            <li><strong>4. Desire for Quick Closeness:</strong> Infatuation often creates a strong desire to become emotionally close very quickly, wanting deep commitment before truly knowing the other person well.</li>
            <li><strong>5. Difficulty Concentrating:</strong> Because thoughts are focused on the person, concentration on schoolwork, chores, or responsibilities may reduce.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="week7">
        <h2>WEEK 7: ACTIONS AND EFFECTS</h2>
        <h3>Day 1: Seed and Harvest</h3>
        <div class="memory-verse">Memory verse: Galatians 6:7 "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."</div>
        <p>All our actions have consequences. They have results though, sometimes, they may not be evident immediately. The consequences will manifest at the appropriate time. Positive or negative, the principle is clear: whatsoever a man sows, that he will reap (Genesis 8:22).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Joab:</strong> Murdered commanders in peacetime. Though it seemed he got away with it, Solomon visited the consequences on him and he was killed (1 Kings 2:5-34).</li>
            <li><strong>Barzillai:</strong> Showed kindness to David during rebellion. His children reaped positive rewards and ate at the King’s table (1 Kings 2:7).</li>
            <li><strong>Shimei:</strong> Cursed David. Though initially forgiven, Solomon eventually brought his gray hair to the grave with blood after he violated specific conditions (1 Kings 2:8-9).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 2: Avoid Unwholesome Actions</h3>
        <p>Unwholesome actions stem from greed, hatred, and delusion. Such actions include taking life, stealing, lying, sowing discord, and idle gossip. Once you take an action, you set in motion a process that will be incomplete without the consequences.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adam & Eve:</strong> Disobeyed God. Result: Spiritual death and fall of man.</li>
            <li><strong>Cain:</strong> Killed Abel. Result: Cursed and became a vagabond.</li>
            <li><strong>Achan:</strong> Stole set-apart things secretly. Result: Stoned to death publicly.</li>
            <li><strong>Ananias & Sapphira:</strong> Lied to the Holy Spirit. Result: Died the same day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). Repent and ask for mercy to deliver you from past negative consequences.</p>

        <h3>Day 3: The Consequences of Disrespect</h3>
        <p>Disrespect is a failure to honor God, authority, and fellow human beings. Disrupting the divine order invites judgment and spiritual consequences.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Towards God:</strong> Korah's rebellion resulted in being swallowed by the earth (Numbers 16).</li>
            <li><strong>Towards Parents:</strong> Exodus 20:12 commands honor; Deuteronomy 21:18-21 shows severe community consequences for rebellious sons.</li>
            <li><strong>Towards Authority:</strong> Romans 13 states resisting authority is opposing what God has set in place.</li>
            <li><strong>Among Peers:</strong> Proverbs 11:12 shows that contempt for a neighbor lacks judgment and leads to social discord.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 4: The Power in Your Action</h3>
        <p>Acts 3:1-7. Power is the ability to act; Action is doing something to achieve goals. <strong>Action speaks louder than voice.</strong></p>
        <p>The only way to create change is to take the first step. Action changes behavior, not the other way around. Nehemiah rebuilt the broken walls by leading and equpping others, not by mere wishful thinking. Graveyards are full of unutilized potential; rising beyond inaction is required to be what God wants you to be (Genesis 1:28).</p>

        <h3>Day 5: Reflection</h3>
        <div class="reflection-box"><strong>Reflection:</strong> Decide to take positive actions today. Your future achievement depends on the seeds you sow now.</div>

    <section id="week8">
        <h2>WEEK 8: HANDLING CHALLENGES</h2>
        <h3>Day 1: Introduction to Challenges</h3>
        <p>A challenge is a difficulty that prevents reaching a goal. Jesus confirms that with Him, we can overcome (John 16:33). Challenges are allowed by God to develop patience (James 1:2-4). <strong>Fanny J. Crosby</strong> became blind at six weeks old but through faith became a renowned poet and hymn writer.</p>
        <h4>Common Causes of Behavioural Challenges:</h4>

            <li>Emotional Regulation (Anxiety, Depression).</li>
            <li>Environmental Factors (Chaotic or unstimulating settings).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 2: Challenges Faced by Teenagers</h3>
        <p>Teens face overwhelming physical, emotional, and hormonal changes. 10 common problems include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Peer Pressure (fitting in).</li>
            <li>Anxiety and Depression (societal and parental pressure).</li>
            <li>Teen Pregnancy (short-term joy leading to long-term complication).</li>

            <li>Social Media Addiction (withdrawal and isolated feelings).</li>
            <li>No Adult Supervision (lack of role models).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Day 3: Balancing Academics and Social Life</h3>
        <p>Striking a balance is essential. Imbalance leads to academic decline, burnout, or social isolation. <strong>Tips for Balance:</strong> Create a schedule, prioritize tasks, set clear goals, and learn to say "No." Use social time as a reward for completing academic tasks. Practice effective communication with family about your needs.</p>

        <h3>Day 4: Spirituality and Academics</h3>
        <p>Spirituality provides a grounding force amidst the school hustle. Aligning academic ambitions with spiritual values adds a deeper sense of purpose to studies. Surrounding yourself with a supportive community and regular reflection ensures efforts align with spiritual aspirations.</p>

        <h3>Day 5: Biblical View on Overcoming</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anger:</strong> Control it (Ephesians 4:26-27). Love is the mightiest weapon.</li>
            <li><strong>Anxiety:</strong> Cast burdens on the Lord (Psalm 55:22). Take breaks (Mark 6:31).</li>
            <li><strong>Fear:</strong> God is our refuge (Psalm 46:1-2). Fear must not stop you from doing right.</li>
            <li><strong>Grief:</strong> Don't deny loss (Jesus wept). Recognizing pain is healthy.</li>
            <li><strong>Overcoming:</strong> Look unto Jesus (Hebrews 12:1-4), focus on your goal, and seek help when needed.</li>

        <h2>WEEK 10: EXAMINATION PART 2 / CRITICAL THINKING</h2>
        <h3>Day 1: Examination Culture</h3>
        <p>Bible Text: 1 Corinthians 14:40 — “Let all things be done decently and in order.”</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Obey invigilators.</li>
            <li>Stick strictly to sitting arrangements.</li>
            <li>No GSM phones or irregular assistance (sign language).</li>
            <li>Observe silence. Raising hands is the only way to attract attention.</li>
            <li>No eating or sleeping in the hall.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 2: Don’t Relent, Remain Focused</h3>
        <p>1 Corinthians 9:24 — “Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.” Give each paper your best effort without cheating to get the highest mark attainable. Press on toward the goal (Philippians 3:14).</p>

        <h3>Day 3: Critical Thinking Part 1</h3>
        <p>Proverbs 23:7 — “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he”.</p>
        <p>Critical thinking is the ability to think clearly and rationally. It is about being an active learner rather than a passive recipient. Critical thinkers question assumptions rather than accepting them at face value. It involves observation, analysis, reflection, and decision making.</p>

        <h3>Day 4: Critical Thinking Part 2</h3>
        <p>Philippians 4:8 — “Think about such things”. Process: Ask yourself Who said it? What did they say? Where did they say it? When did they say it? Why did they say it? Use foresight to consider the impact of your decisions on others before you act.</p>

        <h3>Day 5: Excellent Spirit</h3>
        <p>Excellence is the state of being exceptionally good. It is a gift from God (James 1:17). Daniel was preferred above presidents because an "Excellent Spirit" was in him (Daniel 6:3). To be excellent is to go the extra mile. An excellent student gives more than what is required.</p>

        <h2>WEEK 11: THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD</h2>
        <h3>Day 1: The Source of Light</h3>
        <p>The law of God serves as a light (Psalm 119:105). Jesus is the true source (“I am the light of the world” - John 8:12). Christians are the reflection of His light, just as the moon reflects the sun. Our function is to shine so others lead to glorifying God.</p>

        <h3>Day 2: Types of Light</h3>
        <p>Two types of light exist: <strong>Physical Light</strong> (handiwork seen) and <strong>Spiritual Light</strong> (Truth and Life). Spiritual light is necessary for spiritual life. True followers will never follow the ways of sin because light exposes evil (John 3:19-20).</p>
        <div class="diagram-placeholder">[Image of a diagram illustrating the moon reflecting light from the sun to represent spiritual reflection]</div>

        <h3>Day 3: Usefulness of the Light</h3>
        <p>Matthew 5:14-16. Light <strong>Guides</strong> (metaphor for truth), <strong>Illuminates</strong> (marking the way to Jesus), and <strong>Takes Moral Lead</strong> (taking a stand against wrongdoing). Even dim lights stand out in the sky universe (Philippians 2:14-16). Our light is the only hope for the world.</p>

        <h3>Day 4: The Power of Light</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Light Shines and Overcomes Darkness: Commands believers to arise (Isaiah 60:1).</li>
            <li>Light Heals: Truth heals spiritual sickness (like curing jaundice in babies).</li>
            <li>Light Dispels Darkness: Light wins without a fight (Ephesians 6:12).</li>
            <li>Light Rules: Gives mastery over deception of darkness.</li>
            <li>Light Quickens: It enlivens and produces life.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Day 5: Significance of the Light</h3>
        <p>Jesus called us to be light-bearers. Light illuminates the way going forward, not what is behind us. Forgive yourself and others. Walk as children of light (Ephesians 5:8). Future residency is Heaven, where there is no darkness or death (Revelation 21:3-5).</p>
